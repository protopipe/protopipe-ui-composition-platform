# 11 – Risks and Technical Debt

## Key Risks

- Platform complexity concentration
- Snapshot artifact sprawl
- Experiment interference
- Observability drift across technologies
- SSR performance bottlenecks

## Mitigations

- Clear ownership and contracts
- Artifact retention and garbage collection policies
- Experiment isolation rules
- Standardized telemetry hooks
- Explicit SSR performance budgets
